# Build an E-commerce with ReactJS

Gatsby - [Official docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/)

### What is Gatsby ??
- It is a **static site generator** means it will produce for us static HTML files we load up on to a server
Static site donot mean not interative or not dynamic.
We can load JS into the HTML files that  Gatsby serves as well as make API calls do interactions & build incredibly rich & immersive sites even 
though they are static in their nature of just being HTML up without programming server -side language.

- It is going to use Node ,Node will be running in a developemnt environment but the final result dont require node to run on the server side
- Uses GraphQL to get Data from anywhere for eg data from markdown files,csv files, databases.
**Note** - Gatsby is not going to handle data for us rather it will get data pulled into Gatsby & generate the site from that data
- Uses React for Templating
- Includes Plugin Architecture


### Why use Gatsby ??
- We use Gatsby for speed security & improve dev experience 
- Gatsby has a solid team, open source coummity & great documenentation
